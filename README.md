FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- we need an intermediate layer between the client side and the mircoservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which mircoservice should actually respond to this request
- We can do messgae validation , response transformation , rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end
